                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Emmanuel Church Tiruchengode was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to see what God can do through ordinary people who are willing to say yes to His call. Located in Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu, what started as a small gathering of believers has grown into a vibrant community of faith, hope, and love.</p>
                <p>We believe that the church is not a building—it's people. It's a movement of believers committed to seeing lives transformed by the power of the Gospel. Every Sunday, every small group, every act of service in Tiruchengode is an opportunity to see God move in miraculous ways.</p>
                <p>As Emmanuel Church Tiruchengode, we are dedicated to serving our local community and spreading the message of hope and transformation throughout Tamil Nadu.</p>

                        <h3>The Bible</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe the Bible is God's written Word, inspired by the Holy Spirit and without error in its original manuscripts. It is the ultimate authority for faith and life, relevant and applicable to every generation. The Bible reveals God's character, His plan for salvation, and His will for how we should live.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>2 Timothy 3:16-17</strong> - "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness."</p>

                        <h3>The Trinity</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe in one God who exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person is fully God, equal in power and glory, yet distinct in role and relationship. The Trinity is a mystery that reveals the relational nature of God and His perfect unity.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>Matthew 28:19</strong> - "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</p>

                        <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, the only Son of God. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, and taught with authority. He died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day. He ascended to heaven and will return to establish His kingdom.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>John 14:6</strong> - "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"</p>

                        <h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe the Holy Spirit is God, present with us to convict, guide, comfort, and empower. The Spirit indwells every believer, producing fruit and spiritual gifts for the building up of the church. The Spirit enables us to live holy lives and empowers us for ministry and mission.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>Acts 1:8</strong> - "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses."</p>

                </div>

                        <h3>Humanity & Salvation</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe God created humanity in His image, but sin entered the world through disobedience, breaking our relationship with God. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Jesus Christ alone. It cannot be earned by good works, but good works flow from genuine faith. When we trust in Christ, we are born again, justified, and adopted into God's family.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong> - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <h3>The Church</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe the church is the body of Christ, made up of all believers throughout history. The local church is a community of believers who gather for worship, teaching, fellowship, and mission. The church exists to glorify God, make disciples, and serve the world. Every believer is called to be part of a local church community.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>Ephesians 4:12</strong> - "To equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up."</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <h3>Eternity</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe in the resurrection of the dead and eternal life. Those who trust in Christ will spend eternity with God in heaven, experiencing perfect joy, peace, and worship. Those who reject Christ will be separated from God for eternity. This reality motivates us to share the Gospel and live with eternal perspective.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        <p><strong>John 3:16</strong> - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."</p>

                        <h3>Baptism & Communion</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We believe baptism is an outward expression of an inward faith, a public declaration of our identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. Communion is a remembrance of Christ's sacrifice and a celebration of our unity in Him. Both are important practices for believers, though they do not save us—only faith in Christ saves.</p>
